## Hello, and Welcome to my Data 180 Readme!

This is a file that allows me to show an example of my code:

###### I'm probably not gonna write any code here though...

```python
#Or have I?
print("This is a file designed to show off that I can create a decent readme file")
# However, Its pretty hard to write a readme for an empty branch, and i dont really know what this readme should be for!
```

1.  Make a Project
2. Post it on github
3. Make a readme

I appear to have done step 3, and then decided to go backwards into step 2!

##### At least I can show off that I am able to use all of the different functions of a readme.md file!

(The files in this Github are links to my website!)
